//Task: Implement a class Pizza, a enum class PizzaSize and a sealed class/interface Ingredient.
//
//      The enum class PizzaSize should contain the following members:
//      - Small
//      - Regular
//      - FamilySize
//
//      There should be Multiple Ingredients available as sealed Implementations.
//      - If the Ingredient has no extra properties it should be represented as data object
//      - If the Ingredient has extra properties represent it as data class
//      - Samples:
//          - Ham -> No extra properties
//          - Salami -> with an extra property spicy as Boolean
//
//      Every Pizza should have the following Properties:
//      - ingredients -> Represented as List<Ingredient>
//      - size -> Represented as PizzaSize enum. This should have a default value of Regular
//      - isVegetarian -> Represented as Boolean. This should be a computed value that is not passed into the constructor
//      The Pizza class should also define the following functions:
//      - bake: prints the ingredients
